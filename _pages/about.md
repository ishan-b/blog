<span class="firstcharacter">I'</span>m a happy guy, books addicted, who loves science and technology in general. Mostly, I try to learn everything I can. In my opinion, getting your hands dirty is the best way to learn a new skill. Most of the time you will find me doing something with my computer or my RasberryPi.

Besides technology, I like books. From Magical adventures in Harry Potter to mind bending Sherlock Holmes' tales, I enjoy them all. I  also like puzzles such as a Rubik's Cube. I can solve one under 30 seconds.

Definitely, I'm not a [guru, jedi, rockstar or a ninja](http://www.marcensign.com/stop-calling-yourself-a-guru-jedi-rock-star-and-ninja-unless-you-are-a-guru-jedi-rock-star-or-ninja/), but I always get my stuff done.
I started out this blog as a homework on Coursera and then it stayed as a part of my hobby. Now I'm trying to be a better blogger.
