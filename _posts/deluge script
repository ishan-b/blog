In the last post we went through a really long process of installing and setting up Deluge on our Ubuntu server. When you want to install Deluge on multiple servers manual process is quite boring. So a couple of weeks ago , I made a bash script to install Deluge in seconds. 

This is actually my first time working with scripts. I learnt quite a lot during this process. i must say, automating your every task is amazing. 

Running this script is very easy. Just follow the steps mentioned below.

Installation:

Step 1

SSH into your server. 

Step 2 

Copy the following command to download script to your server

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/e-sean/deluge/master/deluge.sh

Run the script

sudo bash deluge.sh

I already had deluge installed on my server and that you can see in the screenshot. 

It also asks you for a username and password which is used for remote connections.

P.S. If the script gives you any errors
